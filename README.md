# algorithms-golang

## Purpose
Implementations and applications of common algorithms in Golang!

## Structure

`algorithms` exports implementations of common algorithms.

`problems` contains example applications and customizations of algorithms to solve coding challenges and real-world problems.

`testhelpers` exports some simple functions for validating algorithms and their applications.

## Validation
Run the `make add-hook` command to add a pre-commit hook to format any changed code and validate that all tests defined in the package pass.
